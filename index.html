          <p id="content">Hi, my name is Cameron. I'm currently a Sales Professional but looking to make the transition to Developer. My experience in sales has improved my life both professionally and personally.
            The success Iâ€™ve had thus far is strictly a product of my work ethic, ability to learn/adapt and then being able to apply all of the skills taught to me in previous experiences. I will apply all of these
            traits towards this class inorder to build a strong foundation on my path toward a career in coding. Thanks!</p>
